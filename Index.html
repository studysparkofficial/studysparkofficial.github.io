    <h2>Thermodynamics 🔥</h2>
    <p>Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. It describes how thermal energy is converted to and from other forms of energy and how it affects matter.</p>

    <h3>🧪 Basic Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>System & Surroundings:</strong> A system is the part of the universe we are studying, while everything else is surroundings.</li>
      <li><strong>Types of Systems:</strong> Open, Closed, and Isolated systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Thermodynamic Processes:</strong> Isothermal, Adiabatic, Isobaric, Isochoric</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🌡️ Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Zeroth Law:</strong> If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.</li>
      <li><strong>First Law:</strong> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> Heat flows from hot to cold body naturally.</li>
      <li><strong>Third Law:</strong> Entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero.</li>
    </ol>
